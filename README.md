# chinese rote learning-inator 5000
 straightup a really simple tkinter app that just tests you chinese words
 
## context
i made this to revise my igcse edexcel non-native mandarin. im chinese but like im not the best chinese person 👉👈 so yeah if there even is anybody that sees this readme and you're also doing igcse edexcel non-native mandarin or just want to remember how to write chinese properly then feel free to use this 😍😍

## little tips from me to you 😤
- set yourself an amount that you want to be tested beforehand
- write them down onto your notebook with the pinyin
- say the word out loud when writing
- for any words you don't know, guess or draw a circle where it should be
- check the answer, if correct move on, otherwise write the correct one down next to your incorrect answer
- if you are unsure about your answer make a note that you were unsure and copy it down five times after you're done with the words
- after you're done with the words, take all the words you got wrong, and copy it down five times. try not to look at the words everytime you copy it down but rather try to recall it from memory unless you really can't do it.
- repeat
- ?
- profit
alternatively you can also straight up just grind them without repeating five times for the things you get wrong just rewrite it once
another good tip would be to study in bursts so like ten minutes of grinding on one day and the next day its another ten minutes or perhaps even grind half an hour per week 🤩🤩 only ting you really need to care about is that you at least retest with periods of break inbetween to solidify your long term memory. the break period will depend on how long it takes you to fully forget, so you want to find a good time where you still remember it but the memory is fading a little bit to practice for that maximum grind
