# chinese rote learning-inator 5000
 straightup a really simple tkinter app that just tests you chinese words

## little tips from me to you 😤
- set yourself an amount that you want to be tested beforehand
- write them down onto your notebook with the pinyin
- say the word out loud when writing
- for any words you don't know, guess or draw a circle where it should be
- check the answer, if correct move on, otherwise write the correct one down next to your incorrect answer
- if you are unsure about your answer make a note that you were unsure and copy it down five times after you're done with the words
- after you're done with the words, take all the words you got wrong, and copy it down five times. try not to look at the words everytime you copy it down but rather try to recall it from memory unless you really can't do it.
- repeat
- ?
- profit
